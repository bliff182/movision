This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Arrested Development Clicky Game!

## Overview

This is a Single-Page Application utilizing React and Create-React-App. Rather than code out every element individually on the page, elements are rendered as a series of reusable components. For example, the different character buttons are only coded once, as a single button component. The different buttons are then mapped from a .json file, which results in the many varying buttons that display on the webpage.

## How to Play

This is a memory game. The purpose of this game is to click on each image once, without repeating any characters. The images will be shuffled after each click, so you'll need to remember which ones you've already clicked! Try and click all 12 characters!
